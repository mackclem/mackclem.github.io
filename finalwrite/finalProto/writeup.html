        <a href="https://mackclem.github.io/finalprototype/">Perfect Night In Generator Prototype</a>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          <h2>Overview</h2>
          The goal for this project was to use API's to create a perfect night in. I wanted to curate a drink, snack/meal, and 
          movie for the user based on their preferences. My prototype's goal is to randomly retrieve these things with hard-coded
          requests. Right now the site is using chocolate as the ingredient to be incorporated, vodka as the alcohol, and the movie
          genre is drama. I was hoping to get this basic API call working before I accept input.

            <h2>Project Scope</h2>
            My project scope has stayed pretty similar now that i have began working on it. I was hoping to maybe 
            have the recipes printed out on the page originally but after seeing the large range of formats they can 
            come in, I have decided to just provide a link instead. 
        </p>

        <h2>Time Management</h2>
            The prototype took me right around the time I thought it would. It was very helpful to start it early on 
            Monday and get my bearings with APIs. Also, starting on Monday meant I could go to Hannah's office hours with initial 
            questions that would have kept me from getting any further on the project. I expect the final iteration to 
            be a similar time commitment.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
            My implementation plan has stayed the same. I plan to continue with figuring out how to get input values 
            from the user and use those to call the API. I need to figure out how to make drop-down menus and how 
            to use that information wit the API. I also expect that I will have to deal with errors from input so 
            I also need to brainstorm how I plan on handling that.
        </p>
        <p class="development">
          <h2>Development</h2>
          My first step in development was to clone the example API project to get a base for my site going. Then, I researched the Apis
          that I needed to use. I used rapidapi to find lots of them because they had really great documentation for each one. After I found 
          the Tasty API, the Cocktail DB, and the Online Movie DB, I went into Visual studio to figure out how to work with them. 
          I decided to make 3 seperate js files to use all of them and then called each in my html. I ran into a problem with the calling
          of the information in the json, but I will get into that in the Issue Deep Dive. Once I figured out how to get the information I 
          needed from the json, I sent back the information with "render." For the snack I sent the name of the recipe and a link, for the 
          cocktail I also sent the name of the recipe and a link, and for the movie I sent the name of the movie and the year. Once I got 
          the hang of working with one API, the rest were a lot easier and I successfully got my site to show a randomized Perfect Night In 
          with hardcoded input for now.

        <p class="issue">
          <h2>Issue</h2>
          The main issue I had was retrieving the values that were inside the json dictionary. I remembered doing it in 310, but I wasn't 
          sure how to do it in js and was getting confused between the array and the dictionary. I was able to hop on to office hours with Hannah 
          where she helped me get the information which uses periods in between the categories you want to get into. I was also having trouble 
          sending the information back to my html, but she helped me with the render function. Everything thus far has gone suprisingly 
          smoothly, and I don't doubt I will have issues coming up as I complete this project.
        </p>
        <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
        <ul class="Ideas and Future">
          <li>Add section to recieve input from the user</li>
          <li>Make the css different from Hannah's and more catered to my site</li>
          <li>Make the links in the boxes clickable to the recipes</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="kudos">
          <h2>Kudos</h2>
          Shout out to to rapid API for having great documentation on each API and how to sign up for them. Also shout out Hannah for 
          helping me on js basics that I haven't grasped yet.
