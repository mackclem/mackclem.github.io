        <b>A little about me!</b>
        I am a design student based out of Seattle who values creativity, inclusivity, and communication. 
        I grew up in Southern California and always had an itch to invent tools that made life easier, like
         a contraption that allowed me to turn my lights off from my bed when I was 10. I realized UX design 
         fit right into my interests and went directly into the Human-Centered Design & Engineering major at 
         the University of Washington.
         I am currently a sophomore at UW and am fortunate to be involved in design clubs, such as Design for America.  
         I am also pursuing a minor in Dance and am part of athletics with the UW Dance Team. 

          When I am not studying, designing, or dancing, Iâ€™m most likely on long hikes with my friends, at a local coffee shop, 
          or flying home just to pet my two dogs.
