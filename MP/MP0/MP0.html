        <h2>Overview</h2>
        I haven't worked with html and css for a year or two so this exploration was a 
        slow process. I first started by copying over every folder that was in MP0. I 
        modified the colors and the font to start with. I then worked through making sub 
        folders for my MP writeups. This crashed Visual Studio multiple times but with some 
        help from peers and the professor, I was able to figure out what happened. I added 
        in images to represent each section as well as captions using figcaption.

        <h2>Issue</h2>
        I ran into a bug with a pop up saying it wasn't connected in the upstream. I force quit
        Visual Studio and entered git status into the terminal. It said there was no upstream so 
        I entered in the command it told me and it resolved itself. I think this stemmed from not 
        saving each file and folder properly before I commit and pushed all the changes.

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        I wanted my pictures to spin when you hovered over them. I chose this because it felt fun and whimsical 
        I did this by going into the index css and adding "transition: width 2s, height 2s, background-color 2s, 
        rotate 2s, transform 1s;" into the .picture and "rotate: 360 deg;" into .picture:hover. This made the 
        pictures spin when you hover over them.
