        <h2>Overview</h2>
        The goal for this project was to have a chrome extension where you could jot down notes and 
        have them save in the extension even if it is closed. I wanted the style to look like a note pad so I chose
        a fun script font for the title. I took some time to figure out how to make the text boxes into
        many seperate boxes rather than one big text block. Below is a gif of how the extension works.

        <h2>Development</h2>
        My first step in development was to figure out which one of the examples was the best to work off
        of. I chose the simplest (hello world) so I could have a grasp of the things I would be changing.
        I went into the HTML to figure out how to make the notepad style. Through a little help from friends
        and some websites, I figured out how to create a block where text can be inputted. I realized a to-do 
        list style would be more fun, and I knew I wanted to add some checkboxes for when you complete the task.
        I got the checkbox into the extension, it wasn't in the right spot yet, but it was there. (see progress
        picture below) Next I worked on making the text box smaller, figuring out how to format the checkboxes
        next to the text, and making a lot of them in a row. I finally produced a notepad with the option to input 
        text and checkoff a list.
        Then I realized that every time I clicked out of the extension, the text would erase which kind of
        defeats the purpose of having a notepad there in the first place. The most complicated part of all of this 
        was figuring out how to use chrome storage to save my inputs. After a lot of searching and help from the 
        prof, I was able to get a text box to save. I decided it was more important to have saved text than 
        checkboxes so I revised my vision and created the final product.

        <h2>Issue</h2>
        It took me a week to figure out how to make the Save button work. I started with a baseline Medium article 
        that used chrome.storage.sync.get to save and retrieve information. It was a start, but it wasn't retrieving
        information from the HTML input. Through Stack Overflow I found some answers to get data into the system, however,
        it was printing on top of my notes instead of staying where the user inputted it (image below). It was a simple fix thanks to
        Hannah where I just editted the destination of the output. It was a challenge to get this all to work, but 
        it was very rewarding when it did.
