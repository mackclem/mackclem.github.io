        <h2>Overview</h2>
        The goal for this project was to have a create a game where the player is the turtle that I created in the last
        project and it has to avoid the sharks and eat the plants. If the turtle touches the sharks the player loses the 
        game. The player has to collect all 10 plants to win the game. Link to game:

        <h2>Development</h2>
        My first step in development was to figure out all of the npm installation and install p5.play through the terminal. 
        I followed the instructions from the class example and had no problem getting it up and running. Then, I used one of 
        the p5.play sites that I will give kudos to below and found a coin collecting game that I could adapt to fit my goals. 
        I figured out how to make both "good coins" and "bad coins" or plants and sharks. Touching a certain type would have a 
        certain outcome of dying or increasing the score. Next, I had to figure out how to get in images for the player sprite and 
        all of the coins. I spent a while trying to figure out how to draw the sprite, but realized that you just have to use 
        an image file to get them into different shapes. Finally, I was able to figure out how to make the plants disappear on 
        a click rather than a hover. I rolled everything up and tried to get it up on gh pages. That's when everything went wrong. 
        I'll go into more detail in the "Issue" section, but I had outdated links in my html and my rollup wasn't working properly. 
        I had to go back through everything, update it to the current syntax, and get the rollup to work. I ended up having to 
        modify my game to eat the plants on the hover because no matter what, the mouse clicking was not working. Overall, 
        I was super happy with the result and it is a fun game to play.

        <h2>Issue</h2>
        I thought I got through this project without any issues until I tried to get it up onto gh pages. Suddenly, there was a 
        blank screen and nothing was working. In hindsight, it could have been resolved by just fixing the rollup code to include 
        "treeshake," but I also had an outdated p5.play version in my html and the syntax was depending on that version. Hannah 
        helped me through updating the links and the syntax of my site and it finally was appearing, it just wasn't working 
        right. The click function would not work and there aren't many examples out there that only do something when you click a 
        certain area. After trying every single suggestion and trick out there, I decided it was okay to have the turtle eat the 
        plant just by hovering and it still was a fun game. Even though I wish I could have figured this out, after 7 hours of trying 
        everything, it wasn't worth it anymore.

        Shout out to Hannah for staying almost an hour after class to help me fix all of my broken code and Prerna for helping 
        me in the beginning stages of installation. Also shout out to this page for being the base of my game and giving me a 
        good template to build off of. https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/making-games-with-p5-play/
