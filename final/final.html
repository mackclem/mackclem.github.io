      <h2>Curating a "Perfect Night In"</h2>
      <ul class="ingredient-list">
        APIs used:
        <li>Cocktail - the cocktail db</li>
        <li>Easy treat for dessert- spoonacular</li>
        <li>Excuse for not going? - excuser</li>
        <li>Movie to watch- open movie database</li> 
        <br>
        <br>
        This site will curate a perfect night in, from a drink, dessert, and movie to watch. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Prototype- Will display a cocktail recipe, dessert recipe, and movie option that is randomized each time. It will grab results from the API’s but the user input will be hard-coded instead
        <br>
        <br>
        Final version- Has a nice layout that accepts user input for the alcohol preferences, dessert options, and movie genre. Will have drop-down menus for each option. Will also format the final “perfect night in” nicely

        4. Make it so the code can take input (but still hardcode it) <br>
        5. Prototype turn-in <br>
